  A yellow triangle warnning icon showed up and this is where I setup my domain after installing Active Directory along with 4 components come with.
  In the picture, I selected add new forest radio button because I don't have other domain exist and I have to create new domain.
  After it setting up my domain, I go through other steps such as setup password for root domain credential and other procedure.
